As a Frontend developer I've worked on many projects using HTML,CSS,TAILWIND CSS,BOOTSTRAP,JAVASCRIPT,JQuery,REACT,REDUX,APIs and FIREBASE. Along the journey I realised my passion existed in learning new things each and everyday,making myself a better developer so that one day I can do something that will impact the world. With this passion, I want to help my clients get the best service from me. I am looking for internships so that I can get hands-on experience and learn the skills that are required to succeed in the real-world and also in return deliver REAL VALUE.",
